            <p>Paws could use the below data visualization charts for depicting it's annual expenditure and ask

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>As per my research I suggest that Paws Rescue group could use ChartJS or CanvasJS. Both the visualization
                tools are easy to implement. As Paws is a non-commercial organization CanvasJS could be used free by
                them. However, one additional observation point about Canvasjs is that I couldn't see the chart when
                I tried veiwing the document offline. i.e., without internet. I wouldn't suggest using "Highcharts" as
                they are a little difficult to implement and customize. User can get lost in all the documentation that
                is available on thier official website. Hence, among the 3 charts I have used for Paws, ChartJS would be
                the most suitable one for the client.</p>

    <!--    1) Create a Chart holder <div> with certain width and height to hold the visualization.
            2) Use the canvasjs CDN
            3) Define the data and labels. Customize the chart as required. I have customized the chart to
                set a required animation duration. Theme has been played around to a dark version. the start 
                angle of the chart is changed to 45degrees. Labels, TooltipContent are adjusted as required. The 
                FontSize of the label is also customized. This chart visulaization lets the user to import the content 
                to an external file. However, I have disabled Export feature for this example. Using this chart is easy
                and the documentation is clear and not so overwhelming.-->
