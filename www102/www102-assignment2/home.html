                <h3 class="c-line">Troublesome software</h3>
                <p>In the majority of cases a computer problem turns out to be software related. These problems are
                    often
                    caused when unfriendly software is installed then removed. They can also be caused by
                    incompatible
                    drivers
                    or software. Due to the complexity of operating systems, the companies who develop them release
                    regular
                    updates
                    to fix errors and potential security vulnerabilities in the original software.
                    It's important to be using a correctly configured device that receives regular updates.</p>

            <div class="g-col">
                <h3 class="c-line">Troublesome hardware</h3>
                <p>Some components wear out with use over time and simply need to be replaced. Any peripheral
                    devices
                    such
                    as printers and
                    scanners can fail to work correctly for many reasons.
                    We use industry approved techniques to diagnose, troubleshoot and remedy problems. If a part
                    needs
                    to be
                    replaced,
                    we'll advise on what we believe to be the most suitable options.
                    In most cases we can fix or source and install an alternative component.</p>

                <p>Technology is advancing at an alarming rate, and it's possible that the top of the range PC

                    The good news is, you don't have to buy a new one to benefit from the latest technology.
                    It's often a simple case of upgrading some of the internal components.
