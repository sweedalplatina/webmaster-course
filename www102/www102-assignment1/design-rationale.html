        <h2>Design Rationale for Nova's Bar & Grill Website</h2>
        <section>
            <h3>These are the sites I used in my research:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://www.stlouiswings.com/">https://www.stlouiswings.com/</a></li>
                <li><a href="http://jackastors.com/">http://jackastors.com/</a></li>
                <li><a href="http://kramersbarandgrill.ca/">http://kramersbarandgrill.ca/</a></li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Audience for this site</h3>
            <p>This site is targeting the adults of the GTA. As Nova’s Bar and Grill in situated in Richmond Hill it 
            will be a feasible commute in the GTA. As technology is widespread and every adult today owns a mobile device, 
            our site can be accessed by them easily. The targeted audience are the adults as Nova’s is a Bar and Grill. 
            Targeted audience might be accompanied with kids often. However, we are not targeting the kids through this 
            site as I believe kids will rarely search the internet for a Bar & Grill. While doing a browser search for Nova’s 
            Bar & Grill the visitor might use keywords like “Nova’s Bar and Grill”, “Novas menu”, “Novas Bar & Grill”, 
            “Novas” etc. These have been addressed in the &lt;meta> tags. I think the visitor can be looking for the Menu, 
            Location,Contact details or wants to check out the images of Nova’s Bar & Grill. 
            All these aspects have been covered in the site design.</p>
			<h3>Site Metaphor</h3>
			<p>Nova’s Bar & Grill site is a simple yet elegant design. Site content is readable and the colour contrast is
			 great. Well defined content and self explanatory menu type can be seen through out the site. 
			 Accessible navigation is provided by having two navigation panels. One is placed below the Client’s name and 
			 another is placed in the footer area. This is done in order to provide an ease to the user. The site is 
			 attractive and user-friendly. Images used give a feel of the food, drinks and ambience Nova’s Bar & Grill has. 
			 The look of the site stimulates your appetite and makes you want to visit the place.</p>
			<h3>Style-based Decisions</h3>
			<p>I have used full-width header and footer area in order to highlight the Client’s name, logo and the Menu bar. 
			 I have used Single column centre aligned layout of 960px for the content of the site as I want my users to stay
			 focused on my content rather than searching around for information. Menu bar is placed right below the client’s 
			 name, so that user access would be easy. I want to provide an ease to the users. I have used 960px max-width for
			 the content as it is a standard. Max-width also makes my site responsive. Navigation panels can be accessed
			 from both the header and footer so that the user need not scroll all the way back to the top to navigate to 
			 another menu. I have used #D3D3D3 background for the #000 type. This passes all the colour contrast 
			 requirements for accessibility as well as it is soothing and readable for the audience without any disability.
			 I have used #FE7773 as the background-colour for the menu bar items for providing an accent to the site. 
			 It also goes along well with the shades present in the Logo. #FE7773 also helps in stimulating the appetite
			 and this will help increasing my client’s business. I used #FE7773 instead of the primary colour Red
			 because I thought it would look too strong with the colour scheme of Nova’s Bar & Grill site. I have made
			 use of Black background-colour for the header and footer areas in order to give a sophisticated and sleek
			 look to the site. Type colour in the header and footer are mainly white to provide a contrast look. I have 
			 made use  'Roboto', sans-serif web font throughout the site except for the h1’s and h2’s. h1 and h2 are 
			 made cursive in order to show a contrast between the content and the headings. I have used the favicon as 
			 I think this will provide branding and weight to the client’s site.</p>
			 <h3>Content-based decision</h3>
			 <p>I have used the following navigations in the navigation panel Home, Menu, Location, Contact, Gallery and 
			 Design Rationale. I have made use of these navigations as I think these menus would be the most important once 
			 the user would be looking for in this site. I have used ‘keywords’ and ‘description’ &lt;meta> tags for Search 
			 Engine Optimization(SEO). Description text would displayed under the Client’s website name while the user makes
			 a browser search. By default ‘robots’ can index the site. I have included Instagram, Facebook and Twitter 
			 handles in the site as it will act like a free marketing to the client’s business. Customer’s coming into
			 Nova’s Bar & Grill will have their check-ins and pictures tagged on these social media platforms. This will
			 play an important role in the free publicity of Nova’s Bar & Grill. Location details have been provided in text 
			 as well as a handy tag on the map.Text description of the location will help screen readers read out the 
			 directions for the people with disabilities.</p>
			 <h3>Obstacles and Challenges encountered</h3>
			 <p>All the 3 sites I referred had an image carousel. I really liked it. But, I couldn’t implement it in my 
			 design as it is outside the scope of my current knowledge. However, I have selected 1 image which will clearly 
			 depicts what Nova’s Bar & Grill. A gallery of images has been included in the design to compensate for the image
			 carousel.</p>
