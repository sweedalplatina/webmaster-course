				<h3>About Us</h3>
					<p>The <a href="https://ago.ca/"><b><em>Gallery of Colour, Shape and Style</em></b></a> opened in August 2016. Located at 1234 Art Nouveau Blvd. 
					in Toronto's downtown core, we have established ourselves as Canada's first and foremost collector of all things colourful.
					Shades and tints abound in our exhibits, our colour palette consistently impresses and our monochromatic galleria soothes the senses. See our amazing colour wheel in the rotunda.
					Our primary and secondary colours are second to none! Visit our Tertiary Garden and relax in our forest of analogous colours and vector shapes.</p>
					<p>The Gallery is essentially the result of Director <a href="https://www.w3schools.com">Dr. Primary</a>’s belief that she could make people more aware of the colours around us.
					 In November 2014, she left her position as the senior curator at the Institute for 
				 	Colour and dedicated herself to turning her vision into reality.</p>
