<!--WCAG Research begin
I have referred the WCAG 2.0 document and Wikipedia for my research.

WCAG research:

WCAG stands for “Web Content Accessibility Guidelines”. It contains a set of guidelines or protocols that need to be followed while building websites or web content, so that it is accessible to everyone. By accessible I mean to say that people should be able to use and operate the user interfaces and the web content even with their disabilities of any form. May it be visual, physical, speech, auditory or any other form. These guidelines also help elderly individuals affected by changing abilities due to ageing. They also focus on devices which provide limited access to users like mobile phones. 

Web Content Accessibility guidelines were published under the Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). 

The latest version of the WCAG is 2.0 which was published in the year 2008. WCAG sets up 12 guidelines under the 4 basic principles. 
Four basic principles of the WCAG are:
•	Perceivable
•	Operable
•	Understandable
•	Robust.

Perceivable
Web contents and user interfaces which are provided to the user must be perceivable. 

For example: if the user has a visual disability then he/she might make use of an assistive technology (digital reader) for accessing the web content. The digital reader reads out the text of the presented content. In this case, he/she won’t be able to see any images present on the web content. Hence, any WCAG complying web content has to make use of a text alternative for the non-text elements. This alternate text describes the image, and it would be read by the digital reader, making it easier for a person with a visual disability to know about the picture.

Operable
Presented User interfaces and navigation must be operable. All the functionalities of the web content must be accessible through the keyboard. 
For example: if the user is unable to move his hands, but use only the keyboard. In this case, he/she must be able to easily navigate the content through the keyboard.

Understandable 
Presented information and the user interface must be easy enough to understand. 
For example: text content must be readable and comprehensible. Selection of the right font would play a role in making the content readable.

Robust 
Presented content must be robust enough that is can be accessed and interpreted through various assistive technologies without loosing its actual meaning. Maintaining the compatibility with the current and future user agents and assistive technologies is of high importance. 
For example: Consider a case of an auditory disabled user. If an audio web content is not robust, it might not generate a text providing the meaning of the audio web content.
