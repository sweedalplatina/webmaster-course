            <h2>WHO ARE THE LEAGUE OF HEROES?</h2>
            <p>The League of Heroes is a band of Earth's mightiest costumed superheroes, who use their superpowers for
                good,
                fighting evil in all its forms.</p>
            <p>The League was founded in Toronto, Canada, by Dr. Goliath and his belief that he could make a better
                world,
                and that the law abiding public deserve more.</p>
            <p>Since our debut on the world stage in 2015, we have established ourselves as the first and foremost
                superhero
                team.</p>

                    <p>He gathered a team of people with the skills and temperament to make the venture a success.The
                        League's
                        first year was spent consolidating funding, acquiring expertise and equipment, as well as
                        constructing
                        the
                        Fortress of Justice.</p>
